# Pomolite

Pomolite is a fast, simple, and distraction-free pomodoro timer.
The app was created in order to boost your productivity,
inspired by the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique),
a time management method that helps you focus on tasks by breaking work into intervals.
